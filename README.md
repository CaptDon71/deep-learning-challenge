# Project Title: Alphabet Soup Charity Optimization

## Project Description

This project focuses on optimizing the allocation of resources for Alphabet Soup Charity using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to develop a model that can help improve charity resource distribution using a neural network-based approach. It includes analyzing charity data and leveraging optimization algorithms to maximize the charity's impact.

## Files Included

1. **Neural-Network-Model-Report.docx**: A comprehensive report detailing the neural network model's structure, methodology, training process, and evaluation results. It also discusses key insights and conclusions based on the model's performance.
   
2. **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and additional details.

3. **Alphabet_Soup/AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that includes the code for optimizing Alphabet Soup Charity's resource allocation using machine learning techniques. It outlines the steps taken for data preprocessing, model training, and optimization, including visualizations.


## Prerequisites
